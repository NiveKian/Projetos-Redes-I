## The project

Bunch of network communications simulations i did for a college subject project
the purpose was to simulate some of the networks layers using java and javafx

## To run

To run the projects is necessary to use the javafx library
and run the code like this:

javac --module-path "javafx PATH HERE" --add-modules=ALL-MODULE-PATH Principal.java
java --module-path "javafx PATH HERE" --add-modules=ALL-MODULE-PATH Principal

find -type f -name "*.class" -delete (just to delete all the class files)

Obs: Maybe the project has some bugs, haven't checked it since a while
